The main target of the program is to validate the txt file (data/rawData.txt) by different criterias.
Firstly before validation all required dataframes are built (using services in DFBuilders ).
After this validators one-by-one check the dataframe and remove invalid information and also store all errors in log file (data/ErrorLogs.txt).
If you run the program you firstly get the initial dataframe, then validated dataframe in console and all error messages in txt file.
